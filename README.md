# clonal_diversity_1KGP

These scripts were used to analyze data from the 1000 Genomes Project. We used them to process data,to extract mutations and quantify gene expression from WGS and RNA-Sequencing samples, then to perform statistical analysis, calculate differential expression, find relationships between genes and effect of these genes on B-cell clonality.
